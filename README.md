# Project Versions and Evaluation

This project has been developed in two main versions: **Version 1** and **Version 2**. Below, you will find explanations of both versions, the preferred data type approach, and project flow diagrams. Additionally, a demo video of the project is available on YouTube.

## Version 1: Weaviate Server-Client Setup

**Version 1** was implemented using a Weaviate vector database configured as a **server-client architecture** using Docker. This version leverages Weaviateâ€™s powerful features for storing and querying data.

For more information on the Docker setup and the Weaviate server-client configuration, refer to [this link](link-to-weaviate-setup).

## Version 2: ElevenLabs Approach and Data Type Method

**Version 2** represents the final and refined version of the project, integrating the **ElevenLabs** approach. This version includes more advanced data processing and analysis methods while providing a more user-friendly experience.

### Preferred Data Type Method

In **Version 2**, the **initially preferred data type method** was used to process, organize, and analyze data. This flowchart illustrates how the data is structured and the chosen methods. Below is the **preferred data type flowchart**.

## Reason for Transition to Version 2

**Version 2** introduces a more comprehensive and user-friendly approach, improving the overall experience. **Version 1**, which primarily relied on the Weaviate server-client architecture, lacked certain features necessary for the intended application. As a result, **Version 2** was preferred. The **ElevenLabs** approach provides more effective and flexible solutions for data processing.
