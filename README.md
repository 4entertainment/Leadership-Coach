# Project Versions and Evaluation

This project has been developed in two main versions: **Version 1** and **Version 2**. Below, you will find explanations of both versions, the preferred data type approach, and project flow diagrams. Additionally, a demo video of the project is available on YouTube.

**I kindly request that the evaluation be conducted based on Version 2.**

## Version 1: Weaviate Server-Client Setup

**Version 1** was implemented using a Weaviate vector database configured as a **server-client architecture** using Docker. This version leverages Weaviateâ€™s powerful features for storing and querying data.

## Version 2: ElevenLabs Approach and Data Type Method

**Version 2** represents the final and refined version of the project. This version includes more advanced data processing and analysis methods while providing a more user-friendly experience.

### Preferred Data Type Method

In **Version 2**, the **initially preferred data type method** was used to process, organize, and analyze data within the overall system architecture. This flowchart illustrates how the structure of the entire system, including data flow, processing stages, and chosen methods. Below is the **preferred data type flowchart**.

### ElevenLabs Approach Flowchart

This flowchart represents the ElevenLabs approach, showing its structure and how it processes data. However, due to API key limitations and time constraints, I was unable to continue with this approach. Instead, I conducted the analysis within the repository under `version2/data`.

### General Project Flowchart

The diagram below illustrates the **overall workflow** of the project, showing the integration of different components:

## Reason for Transition to Version 2

**Version 2** introduces a more comprehensive and user-friendly approach, improving the overall experience. **Version 1**, which primarily relied on the Weaviate server-client architecture, lacked certain features necessary for the intended application. Additionally, Weaviate was developed on a system with insufficient GPU resources, which posed limitations. As a result, **Version 2** was preferred. Although the **ElevenLabs** approach initially seemed promising, I was unable to continue using it due to API quota limitations.
